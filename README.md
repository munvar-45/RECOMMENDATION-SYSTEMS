#DESCRIPTION:

In this project, I built a Product Recommendation System using collaborative filtering with Matrix Factorization (SVD).
The main goal is to suggest the best products to users based on their past ratings and similarities with other users.

I created a mini dataset with users and product ratings (just like a small version of Amazon). Then I trained the model using the Surprise library, where SVD helps predict how much a user would like a product they haven’t rated yet.

The model's accuracy is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). A lower RMSE shows the model is predicting ratings closely to actual values.

Finally, I generated Top 2 product recommendations for each user, based on the highest predicted ratings
This system works like those used by Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix, etc. It helps users discover the right products by analyzing behavior patterns — increasing engagement and satisfaction.

It’s simple but powerful. A good example of applying machine learning in the real world.
Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas

Surprise Library (for SVD, train-test split, evaluation)
This project helped me understand how real-world recommendation systems work and gave me hands-on experience with collaborative filtering using Python
Overall, I built a mini product recommender just like Amazon — simple, clean, and totally self-done
